## Baroclinic eddies

This test involves a 3D periodic channel with rotation. The initial state is a sinusoidal temperature front

$$\Theta(x,y,z) = \Theta_0(z) - \Delta \Theta \left(1 - \frac{y - y_w(x)}{\Delta y}\right),$$

where $\Theta_0(z)$ is a linearly stratified background, and $y_w(x)$ defines the front

$$y_w(x) = y_0 - y_A \sin\left(2\pi k \frac{x}{L_x}\right).$$

A perturbation is added to the crest of one of the waves to promote baroclinic instability. The region over which the perturbation is added is bounded by $x_2 \le x \le x_3$ and $y'_w - \Delta y / 2 \le y \le y'_w + \Delta y / 2$, where

$$y'_w(x) = y_0 - \frac{y_A}{2}\sin\left(\pi \frac{x - x_2}{x_3 - x_2}\right).$$

The perturbation itself is defined by the temperature anomaly

$$\Theta'(x,y) = \Delta\Theta'\left(1 - \frac{y - y'_w(x)}{\Delta y / 2}\right)$$

The domain is 160km wide by 500km long, with a depth of 1000m. Experiments were performed at horizontal resolutions of 1km, 4km and 10km, at a constant uniform vertical resolution of 50m.
