  abstract = {This paper examines spurious dianeutral transport within a suite of ocean models (GOLD, MITgcm, MOM, and ROMS). We quantify such transport through a global diagnostic that computes the reference potential energy, whose evolution arises solely through transport between density classes. Previous studies have focused on the importance of accurate tracer advection schemes in reducing the spurious transport and closure. The present study highlights complementary issues associated with momentum transport. Spurious dianeutral transport is shown to be directly proportional to the lateral grid Reynolds number (Re$\Delta$), with such transport significantly reduced when Re$\Delta$ \&lt; 10.

Simulations with the isopycnal model GOLD provide a benchmark for the smallest level of spurious dianeutral transport realizable in our model suite. For idealized simulations with a linear equation of state, GOLD exhibits identically zero spurious dianeutral mixing, and thus maintains a constant reference potential energy when all physical mixing processes are omitted. Amongst the non-isopycnal models tested in idealized simulations, ROMS generally produces smaller spurious dianeutral mixing than MITgcm or MOM, since ROMS makes use of a higher order upwind-biased scheme for momentum transport that enforces a small Re$\Delta$. In contrast, MITgcm and MOM both employ unbiased (centered) discretizations of momentum transport, and therefore rely on lateral friction operators to control the grid Reynolds number. We find that a lateral shear-dependent Smagorinsky viscosity provides an effective means to locally reduce Re$\Delta$, and thus to reduce spurious dianeutral transport in MITgcm and MOM.

In addition to four idealized simulations, we quantify spurious dianeutral transport in realistic global ocean climate simulations using GOLD and MOM with a realistic equation of state for seawater, both with and without mesoscale eddies in the resolved flow field. The GOLD simulations have detectable levels of spurious cabbeling from along isopycnal advective truncation errors. Significantly larger spurious dianeutral transport arises in a non-eddying MOM simulation. In an eddying MOM simulation, spurious dianeutral transport is larger still but is reduced by increasing momentum friction.},

The concept of gravitational available potential energy is used to formulate an energy budget in which the evolution of the background potential energy, i.e. the minimum potential energy attainable through adiabatic motions, can be explicitly examined. For closed systems, the background potential energy can change only due to diabatic processes. The rate of change of background potential energy is proportional to the molecular diffusivity. Changes in the background potential energy provide a direct measure of the potential energy changes due to irreversible diapycnal mixing. For open systems, background potential energy can also change due to boundary fluxes, which can be explicitly measured. The analysis is particularly appropriate for evaluation of diabatic mixing rates in numerical simulations of turbulent flows. The energetics of a shear driven mixing layer is used to illustrate the analysis.},

The applicability of the method is demonstrated for four test cases: (i) a one-dimensional linear advection equation with periodic boundary conditions, (ii) a two-dimensional flat-bottom lock exchange test case without mixing, (iii) a two-dimensional marginal sea overflow study with mixing and entrainment and (iv) the DOME test case with a dense bottom current propagating down a broad linear slope.

  abstract = {The meridional overturning circulation (MOC) is composed of interconnected overturning cells that transport cold dense abyssal waters formed at high latitudes back to the surface. Turbulent diapycnal mixing plays a primary role in setting the rate and patterns of the various overturning cells that constitute the MOC. The focus of the analyses in this paper will be on the influence of sharp vertical variations in mixing on the MOC and ocean stratification. Mixing is enhanced close to the ocean bottom topography where internal waves generated by the interaction of tides and geostrophic motions with topography break. It is shown that the sharp vertical variations in mixing lead to the formation of three layers with different dynamical balances governing meridional flow. Specifically, an abyssal bottom boundary layer forms above the ocean floor where mixing is largest and hosts the northward transport of the heaviest waters from the southern channel to the closed basins. A deep layer forms above the bottom layer in which the upwelled waters return south. A third adiabatic layer lies above the other two. While the adiabatic layer has been studied in detail in recent years, the deep and bottom layers are less appreciated. It is shown that the bottom layer, which is not resolved or allowed for in most idealized models, must be present to satisfy the no flux boundary condition at the ocean floor and that its thickness is set by the vertical profile of mixing. The deep layer spans a considerable depth range of the ocean within which the stratification scale is set by mixing, in line with the classic view of Munk in 1966.},

A limiter for this scheme is fully described that never decreases the polynomial degree, except at the location of extrema. We assess the use of high-order explicit and implicit (i.e., compact) estimates for the edge values and slopes needed to build the piecewise polynomials in both piecewise parabolic method (PPM) and PQM. It is shown that all limited PQM schemes perform significantly better than limited PPM schemes and that PQM schemes are much more cost-effective.},

The vertical grid adaptivity is partially given by a vertical diffusion equation for the vertical layer positions, with diffusivities being proportional to shear, stratification and distance from the boundaries. In the horizontal, the grid can be smoothed with respect to z-levels, grid layer slope and density. Lagrangian tendency of the grid movement is supported. The adaptive terrain-following grid can be set to be an Eulerian\textendash{}Lagrangian grid, a hybrid $\sigma$ \textendash $\rho$ or $\sigma$ \textendash{}z grid and combinations of these with great flexibility. With this, internal flow structures such as thermoclines can be well resolved and followed by the grid. A set of idealised examples is presented in the paper, which show that the introduced adaptive grid strategy reduces pressure gradient errors and numerical mixing significantly. The grid adaption strategy is easy to implement in various types of terrain-following ocean models. The idealised examples give evidence that the adaptive grids can improve realistic, long-term simulations of stratified seas while keeping the advantages of terrain-following coordinates.},

  abstract = {The vertical coordinate of the Model for Prediction Across Scales-Ocean (MPAS-Ocean) uses the Arbitrary Lagrangian\textendash{}Eulerian (ALE) method, which offers a variety of configurations. When fully Eulerian, the vertical coordinate is fixed like a z-level ocean model; when fully Lagrangian there is no vertical transport through the interfaces so that the mesh moves with the fluid; additional options for vertical coordinates exist between these two extremes, including z-star, z-tilde, sigma, and isopycnal coordinates. Here we evaluate spurious diapycnal mixing in MPAS-Ocean in several idealized test cases as well as real-world domains with full bathymetry. Mixing data is compared to several other ocean models, including the Parallel Ocean Program (POP) z-level and z-star formulations. In three-dimensional domains, MPAS-Ocean has lower spurious mixing that other ocean models. A series of simulations show that this is likely due to MPAS-Ocean's hexagon-type horizontal grid cells combined with a flux-corrected transport tracer advection scheme designed for these unstructured meshes.

The frequency-filtered vertical coordinate of Leclair and Madec (2011) (also called z-tilde) has been implemented and analyzed in MPAS-Ocean. This addition allows low-frequency vertical transport to pass through the vertical interface in an Eulerian manner, while high-frequency vertical oscillations, such as internal gravity waves, are treated in a Lagrangian manner. Z-tilde leads to a substantial reduction in vertical transport across layer interfaces, and a reduction in spurious diapycnal mixing.},

We formulate the equations of horizontal motion, hydrostatic balance, mass continuity, and thermodynamics using a generalized vertical coordinate in which any variable that gives a single-valued monotonic relationship with a geometric height can be used as a vertical coordinate. Conditions to conserve total energy in a generalized vertical coordinate are investigated. Various prediction schemes using pressure, height, and potential temperature as a vertical coordinate are derived from the set of basic equations in the generalized coordinate system. These three coordinate systems are unique in that the features of prediction equations in each system are all distinct. We place special emphasis on handling the earth's orography as the lower boundary condition. As an extension of the original idea of Phillips applied to the pressure-coordinate system, we propose transformed height and isentropic systems. In those systems, both the top of the model atmosphere and the earth's surface are always coordinate surfaces. It is hoped that these new schemes, as in the case of the Phillips' sigma-system, will enable us to handle the effect of the earth's orography in the prediction models without lengthy coding logic.},

  abstract = {The Southern Ocean has shown little warming over recent decades, in stark contrast to the rapid warming observed in the Arctic. Along the northern flank of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, however, the upper ocean has warmed substantially. Here we present analyses of oceanographic observations and general circulation model simulations showing that these patterns\textemdash{}of delayed warming south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and enhanced warming to the north\textemdash{}are fundamentally shaped by the Southern Ocean's meridional overturning circulation: wind-driven upwelling of unmodified water from depth damps warming around Antarctica; greenhouse gas-induced surface heat uptake is largely balanced by anomalous northward heat transport associated with the equatorward flow of surface waters; and heat is preferentially stored where surface waters are subducted to the north. Further, these processes are primarily due to passive advection of the anomalous warming signal by climatological ocean currents; changes in ocean circulation are secondary. These findings suggest the Southern Ocean responds to greenhouse gas forcing on the centennial, or longer, timescale over which the deep ocean waters that are upwelled to the surface are warmed themselves. It is against this background of gradual warming that multidecadal Southern Ocean temperature trends must be understood.

  doi = {10.1016/0021-9991(66)90014-3},
  abstract = {An Eulerian finite difference method is presented which can be used with a high-speed computer to solve the time-dependent equations of motion for the compressible flow of a fluid. The difference equations are described in detail, and the nature of the truncation errors introduced by the numerical approximations is discussed, as are the stability properties of the equations. Three solutions involving time-dependent flow in two space dimensions are described and analyzed: the diffraction of a weak shock travelling through a z-shaped tunnel, the interaction of a supersonic blunt body with a plane shock wave, and the passage of a plane shock over a conical body. Good agreement with experimental data is obtained in all cases where comparisons are made.},
