## Resting/reference/background potential energy
A physically relatable measurement of spurious mixing comes from the reference potential energy (RPE; Winters et al., 1995). This is the lowest attainable potential energy of a given fluid, with no energy available for motion. To obtain this state, the fluid is adiabatically resorted to a stable stratification, where every fluid parcel is spread laterally across the entire domain. The sum of the reference potential energy and the available potential energy (APE) gives the total potential energy in the system. Mathematically, the RPE is expressed as

$$\mathrm{RPE} = g \int_\Omega z \rho^*(z)\,\mathrm dV,$$

where $\rho^*$ is the adiabatically resorted density profile, known as the reference density. The reference density is well-defined when a linear equation of state is used. However, when a nonlinear equation of state is used, a fluid parcel's density depends on its depth (more precisely, it's hydrostatic pressure), which changes when the domain is resorted. A naive resorting of fluid parcels under a nonlinear equation of state may not be stably stratified due to this compressibility effect.

While it's possible to exactly calculate the reference density profile for a non-linear equation of state, it's very expensive (appendix of Ilicak et al., 2012). Using an approximation, such as calculating the density using a reference pressure significantly decreases the cost of the calculation, at the expense of incurring an error in the RPE. An alternative is to construct a volume frequency distribution of fluid parcels as a function of temperature and salinity (Saenz et al., 2015). This has a lower computational cost than adiabatic sorting, but again doesn't capture compressibility effects, which are argued to be minor. For simplicity of calculation we will use a linear equation of state. This eliminates the consequences of a nonlinear equation of state such as cabbeling and thermobaricity, as well as the effect of compressibility on the reference profile. Computation of the RPE is inexpensive and exact for a given fluid state, as no approximations are made during construction of the reference density profile.

In a numerical model of the hydrostatic shallow water equations that exhibits identically zero mixing, with no buoyancy forcing, every fluid parcel must necessarily maintain its temperature and salinity. Under a linear equation of state, the density of any fluid parcel is thus constant. In this case, the adiabatic resorting of the entire fluid yields an unchanging reference density profile and therefore constant RPE, regardless of the actual depth or location of the parcels. Thus, when all parameterised mixing (e.g. vertical diffusion) is disabled, and there is no buoyancy forcing, a model with zero spurious mixing will have constant RPE.

It is very unlikely that a model would experience exactly zero spurious mixing under nontrivial conditions. By designing experiments with all explicit mixing disabled and without buoyancy forcing, any increase in RPE over time can be attributed to spurious mixing as a result of the model's dynamics. As an example, consider a limited advection scheme, i.e. one which is unable to create denser or lighter densities than already exist. Spurious mixing will create (or add to) some intermediate density class between two pre-existing densities. Considering the new reference density profile, it is clear that the centre of mass of the adiabatically resorted fluid is higher than prior to mixing. This manifests as in increase in the RPE. Conversely, RPE can only be decreased by lowering the centre of mass of the adiabatically resorted fluid.

## Splitting up contributions (*better subsection heading*)

In many models, there's an explicit distinction between the horizontal (along-coordinate) and vertical dynamics. This is particularly the case in models with a generalised vertical coordinate, such as those employing the ALE algorithm. MOM6 performs its regridding/remapping implementation of ALE in a distinct part of a timestep, after the horizontal dynamics have been resolved. Taking advantage of this distinction, we can diagnose the instantaneous RPE at multiple points during a single timestep; at the beginning of a timestep, after horizontal dynamics, and after regridding/remapping has been performed. We denote these three calculations of instantaneous RPE as $\text{RPE}_i$, $\text{RPE}_h$ and $\text{RPE}_v$, respectively. The change in RPE due to horizontal dynamics is simply $\text{RPE}_h - \text{RPE}_i$, and similarly the change due to regridding/remapping is $\text{RPE}_v - \text{RPE}_h$.

The RPE contributions must be carefully calculated so that they include only information from relevant portions of a single timestep. This means that the increases in RPE may be small, from slight changes in density or fluid parcel volume. Diagnosing an instantaneous rate of change of RPE within a timestep may then involve dividing a small change in RPE by a short delta time, an operation that may be imprecise in floating-point arithmetic. In order to derive a significant result from these RPE changes, we ensure that a sufficient number of samples are taken.

Previous analyses of spurious mixing through changes in RPE have only used a timeseries of RPE taken from a single location in a timestep. This means that spurious mixing is only diagnosed for the model as a whole, and can't be attributed to any finer grain parts of the dynamics. Our extension of splitting up RPE contributions allows us to address the interplay of different components, such as the order of advection scheme chosen, the order of accuracy of vertical reconstruction used for remapping, and the specific impact of choice of vertical coordinate. Determining the direction of spurious mixing is also important because of the anisotropy of horizontal and vertical coordinates in ocean models. Spurious mixing in the horizontal direction may be broadly isopycnal, and thus lead to cabbeling or thermobaric effects if a nonlinear equation of state is used. It is important to remember that horizontal spurious mixing may still be diapycnal, and indeed this is how it manifests in an RPE change with a linear equation of state. Conversely, spurious mixing across vertical surfaces, due to regridding/remapping, is likely to have a more direct effect on the stratification within a given water column. This is an important consideration for evaluation vertical coordinates.
